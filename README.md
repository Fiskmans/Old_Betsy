# Old Betsy
An open-souce game engine for anyone who wants to develop a game 'closer to the metal'

It's been developed with the focus of making it feel nice and cozy to use, avoiding jagged edges, weird quirks and funky gotchas.

Making a game in old betsy should feel like drinking a cup of hot cocoa infront of a fireplace on the day after christmas, everything is nice, just works and you can relax knowing all is cared for.

## UNDER MAINTENANCE
the engine is currently being migrated from Pre_cmake to cmake, with some fairly significant rewrites taking place at the same time.

Come back later or check out an old commit if you want a working engine
